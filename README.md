A simple script for picking random winning entries from a list

### Usage

drawing file draws

Where file is a file that contains each of the entries to be picked from,
one entry per line, with no extra whitespace in the file.

Draws is the number of winners who should be picked. After each winner
is picked they are automatically removed from the entry list (but only
the winning entry is removed; if an entry appears twice in the list,
for instance, only the winning one is removed).
